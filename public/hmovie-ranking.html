<h2>Top 3 Movies:</h2>

<hr>
<br>
<h3>Inception</h3> 
<p>This film for me was a great eye opner into the idea of inception</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>This is another great film</p>

<h3>Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>A great film, inspiring for those in sales, or generally any one who enjoys a success story-however the film does show the whole life cycle of jordans success as much as it shows his losses</p>
